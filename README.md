# windows-bitcoin-sv-bin
A basic [Unofficial] DIY compile of bitcoin-sv-1.0.2-x86-64 purely for RegTest use on windows - use at your own risk

I was having issues with the files getting corrupted over the wire to sourceforge etc. or with adding them to a .zip archive
and commiting them this way fixed the problem.
